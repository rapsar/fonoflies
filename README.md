# fonoflies
fonoflies is an experimental project to transform spatiotemporal coordinates of firefly flashes into melodies.

This repository contains the html/CSS files, the data (.csv) files, and the code (Matlab and Ruby for Sonic Pi).

This is a proof of concept and work in progress; contributions and feedback very much welcome!
